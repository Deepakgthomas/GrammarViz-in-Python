# GrammarViz-in-Python

This reposiotry contains python code for GrammarViz 3.0. The original tool developed by Senin et al. was made using Java and we decided to develop a python version of the same. We hope that the users of this tool can utilize the various libraries that Python provides (especially for ML) and further augment it for improved time-series analysis.
